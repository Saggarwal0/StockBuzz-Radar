**StockBuzz Radar** is a Python-based project that examines how people on Reddit talk about specific stocks.  
By collecting recent posts that mention a chosen ticker and running sentiment analysis on the text,  
the tool produces a clear snapshot of the online emotional climate surrounding that stock.

The purpose of this project is both technical and reflective: it combines API integration,  
natural language processing, and data interpretation in a way that feels analytical but still approachable.  
As a student developing foundational skills in programming and cloud technologies,  
I wanted to create something real, relevant, and meaningful—not just another tutorial script.

This tool captures online sentiment not to predict markets,  
but to highlight how digital communities shape the perception of companies  
and influence public reactions.

### 🌙 **Academic-style Disclaimer**

StockBuzz Radar is an educational and exploratory project.  
It does **not** provide investment advice, forecast prices, or guarantee accuracy.  
All analysis is based solely on publicly available online discussions.

## 🌙 **Purpose and Motivation**

Many freshman composition courses emphasize how language reflects emotion, culture, and community values.  
I wanted to bring that same lens into a technical space. Reddit, with its dramatic mix of analysis,  
sarcasm, enthusiasm, and skepticism, provides a perfect environment for studying how people express  
attitudes toward financial topics.
